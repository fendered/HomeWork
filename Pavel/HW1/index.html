          Philip Emeagwali is a Nigerian
          <a href="https://www.pornhub.com/"> computer scientist.</a> He has
          been living in the United States for many years. [1] He won the 1989
          <a href="https://www.pornhub.com/">Gordon Bell Priez</a> ($1,000) for
          price-performance in high-performance computing applications, in an
          oil reservoir modeling calculation using a novel mathematical
          formulation <br />
          and implementation.[2][3]

        <h2 id="id1">Biography</h2>
        <p style="font-weight: 400">
          Emeagwali was born in Akure, Nigeria on 23 August 1954.[4] His early
          schooling was suspended in 1967 as a result of the Nigerian Civil War.
          At 13 years, he served in the Biafran army. After the war he completed
          high-school equivalence through self-study. He is married to Dale
          Brown Emeagwali, a noted African-American microbiologist.[5]

      <div>
        <h2 id="id3">Education</h2>
        <p style="font-weight: 400">
          He traveled to the United States to study under a scholarship
          following completion of a correspondence course at the Univers ity of
          London. He received a bachelor's degree in mathematics from Oregon
          State University in 1977. He later moved to Washin gton DC, receiving
          in 1986 a master's degree from George Washi ngton University in ocean
          and marine engineering, and a second master's in applied mathematics
          from the University of Maryla nd. Next magazine suggested that
          Emeagwali claimed to have fu rther degrees.[6][7] During this time, he
          worked as a civil e ngineer at the Bureau of Land Reclamation in
          Wyoming.
        </p>
        <h3 id="id4">Court case and the denial of degree</h3>
        <p style="font-weight: 400">
          Emeagwali studied for a Ph.D. degree from the University of Michigan
          from 1987 through 1991. His thesis was not accepted by a committee of
          internal and external examiners and thus he was not awarded the
          degree. Emeagwali filed a court challenge, stating that the decision
          was a violation of his civil rights and that the university had
          discriminated against him in several ways because of his race. The
          court challenge was dismissed, as was an appeal to the Michigan state
          Court of Appeals.[8]

        <h2 id="id5">Supercomputing</h2>
        <p style="font-weight: 400">
          Emeagwali received the 1989 Gordon Bell Prize for an application of
          the CM-2 massively-parallel computer. The application used
          computational fluid dynamics for oil-reservoir modeling. He received a
          prize in "price/performance" category, with a performance figure of
          about 400 Mflops/$1M.[15] The winner in the "performance" category,
          was also the winner of the Price/performance category, but unable to
          receive two prizes. Mobil Research and Thinking Machines, used the
          CM-2 for seismic data processing and achieved the higher ratio of 500
          Mflops/$1M. The judges decided on one award per entry.[3][2] His
          method involved each microprocessor communicating with six
          neighbors.[10]
        </p>
        <p style="font-weight: 600">
          Emeagwali's simulation was the first program to apply a pseudo-time
          approach to reservoir modeling.[1]
